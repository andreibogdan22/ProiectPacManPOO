# Maze Chase Game

## Overview
This project is a **2D arcade-style maze chase game**, inspired by the classic 1980 arcade game released by Namco. The player controls a yellow, circular character that moves through a maze, collecting dots ("pellets") while avoiding patrolling enemies (ghosts).  

Special items called **power pellets** temporarily turn enemies vulnerable, allowing the player to eat them for bonus points. The game combines **strategy, quick reflexes, and memorization of paths**, making it an engaging programming and gameplay challenge.

This project is a **replica of the classic arcade game**, implemented to practice C++ programming concepts and game development techniques.

## Features & Requirements Implemented
The game is implemented in **C++** and demonstrates the following programming concepts:

- ✅ **Code organization**: Separation of classes into header (.h/.hpp) and source (.cpp) files.  
- ✅ **Inheritance**: At least one base class and three derived classes within the same hierarchy.  
- ✅ **Virtual functions**: Including pure virtual functions.  
- ✅ **Use of STL (Standard Template Library)** for data structures and algorithms.  
- ✅ **C++ style casts**.  
- ✅ **Template classes and functions**.  
- ✅ **Design patterns** (applied where appropriate for modularity and scalability).
